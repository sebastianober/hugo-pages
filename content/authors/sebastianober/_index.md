My name is Sebastian Ober and I am currently a Senior Scientist for ML in AstraZeneca’s Biologics Engineering group. I recently completed my PhD in the ML group at the University of Cambridge and have also worked in the tech start-up Secondmind as an ML researcher.

My current research interest centres around the application of ML to use cases relevant to the design of biologics. This is challenging because the process that biologists use to obtain data are often noisy and impose many constraints that are difficult to model, requiring a combination of various generative modelling and supervised learning approaches I believe that probabilistic modelling and active learning, combined with high throughput assays and experimental setups can help us to unlock new and more effective biologic designs.
